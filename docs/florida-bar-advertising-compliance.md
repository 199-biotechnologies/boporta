## Legal Framework & Primary Sources

### Primary Authority

#### Florida Bar Rules Regulating The Florida Bar, Chapter 4

**Rule 4-7.2(c)(1)** - Communications Concerning a Lawyer's Services
*"A lawyer shall not make or permit to be made a false, misleading, deceptive, or unfair communication about the lawyer or the lawyer's services."*

**Rule 4-7.2(c)(1)(F)** - Prohibition on Past Results
*Prohibits "any statement in lawyer advertising that contains any reference to past successes or results obtained or is otherwise likely to create an unjustified expectation about results the lawyer can achieve."*

**Rule 4-7.2(c)(1)(G)** - Prohibition on Guarantees
*Prohibits "statements promising or guaranteeing results in any case."*
**Rationale:** Promised results may not occur in all cases; each case is different; such promises are misleading to the public and prospective clients.

[Source: Rules Regulating The Florida Bar, Subchapter 4-7, as amended effective August 21, 2023]

**Rule 4-7.13** - Deceptive and Inherently Misleading Advertisements
A lawyer may not engage in deceptive or inherently misleading advertising. An advertisement is deceptive if it:
1. Contains a material statement that is factually or legally inaccurate
2. Omits information necessary to prevent the information from being misleading
3. Implies the existence of a material nonexistent fact

Deceptive advertisements include statements that:
- A prospective client can reasonably interpret as a prediction or guaranty of success or specific results
- Reference past results unless objectively verifiable
- Characterize a lawyer's skills, experience, or reputation unless objectively verifiable

[Source: Florida Bar Rule 4-7.13, as amended effective August 21, 2023]

**Rule 4-7.14** - Potentially Misleading Advertisements
Prohibits attorneys from stating or implying that a lawyer specializes in an area of law unless the lawyer is board certified by The Florida Bar Board of Legal Specialization & Education or accredited national organizations.

Terms "expert," "specialist," or "specialize" are reserved for attorneys who have earned board certification.

[Source: Florida Bar Rule 4-7.14]

---

### Florida Supreme Court Precedent

**Case No. SC2022-1294** (June 2023)
The Florida Supreme Court amended disclaimer requirements, changing the standard from **"reasonably prominent"** to **"clear and conspicuous"** for all required information and disclaimers in advertisements.

**Practical Impact:** Higher visibility requirement for disclaimers. They must be immediately noticeable, use readable font size, have visual contrast, and use plain language. Cannot be buried in fine print.

[Source: Florida Supreme Court Opinion SC2022-1294, effective August 21, 2023]

**Pit Bull Advertisement Case**
The Florida Supreme Court found that lawyer advertisements containing an illustration of a pit bull canine and telephone number 1-800-pitbull were **false, misleading, and manipulative** because use of that animal implied the advertising lawyers would engage in "combative and vicious tactics" that would violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.

**Principle:** Visual imagery and aggressive language must not suggest unethical or vicious tactics.

[Source: Florida Supreme Court advertising precedent]

---

### Standing Committee on Advertising Interpretations

The Florida Bar Standing Committee on Advertising reviews advertisements and issues opinions interpreting the rules. Key findings:

**"I will pursue an acquittal" - PERMITTED**
Does not promise a specific legal result; merely conveys that the lawyer will try to obtain an acquittal on behalf of the prospective client.

**"Get A Fresh Start!" - PROHIBITED**
Creates unjustified expectations in violation of Rule 4-7.2(c)(1)(F).

**"Money Back Guarantee" - PROHIBITED (for most non-criminal cases)**
The Committee found the following misleading under Rule 4-7.2(c)(1)(A): "TRAFFIC TICKET & DUI ATTORNEYS MONEY BACK GUARANTEE* NO POINTS* NO SCHOOL* *most non-criminal cases" because the guarantee does not include all cases represented.

### Official Handbook

**Handbook on Lawyer Advertising and Solicitation**
The Florida Bar Ethics and Advertising Department, August 16, 2023 edition.

Provides breakdowns for each type of advertisement, frequently asked questions, checklists, and examples of complying and non-complying advertisements.

## Core Prohibition: Guarantees & Promises

### What You CANNOT Say

Florida Rules 4-7.2(c)(1)(F) and (G) **explicitly prohibit**:

❌ **Statements promising or guaranteeing results**
❌ **Predictions of success in any case**
❌ **References to past successes that create unjustified expectations**

### Examples of PROHIBITED Language

These statements violate Florida Bar Rules:

| Prohibited Statement | Why It Violates | Rule Citation |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| "I will win your case" | Promises specific result | 4-7.2(c)(1)(G) |
| "I will get you acquitted" | Guarantees outcome | 4-7.2(c)(1)(G) |
| "I will save your home" | Promises specific result | 4-7.2(c)(1)(G) |
| "I can save your home" | Implies guaranteed capability | 4-7.2(c)(1)(F) |
| "We win every case" | Promises success in all cases | 4-7.2(c)(1)(G) |
| "Guaranteed success" | Explicit guarantee | 4-7.2(c)(1)(G) |
| "100% success rate" | Creates unjustified expectation | 4-7.2(c)(1)(F) |
| "I will get charges dropped" | Promises specific outcome | 4-7.2(c)(1)(G) |
| "Get A Fresh Start!" | Creates unjustified expectation | 4-7.2(c)(1)(F)* |

*Standing Committee Finding

### The Legal Standard

**The Test:** Would a reasonable prospective client interpret this as a promise of a specific result?

- If YES → Prohibited (must revise)
- If NO → Evaluate for unjustified expectations

---

## The 2023 Standard: Clear & Conspicuous Disclaimers

### The New Requirement

**Effective August 21, 2023**, disclaimers must be **"clear and conspicuous"** (not merely "reasonably prominent").

[Source: Florida Supreme Court Case No. SC2022-1294, effective August 21, 2023]

### What "Clear and Conspicuous" Means

✓ **Proximity** - Disclaimer near the claim (same page, visible without scrolling)
✓ **Size** - Readable font size (minimum 12pt recommended, never below 10pt)
✓ **Contrast** - Visually distinct (dark text on light background, or vice versa)
✓ **Clarity** - Plain language, not legalese
✓ **Placement** - Above the fold on web pages for primary claims

### Required Disclaimer Language

#### Standard Outcome Variability Disclaimer

```
"Each case is unique. Outcomes depend on specific facts, evidence, and
circumstances. Past results do not guarantee future outcomes."
```

#### Enhanced Version (Recommended)

```
"Results vary based on the specific facts and circumstances of each case.
No attorney can guarantee any particular outcome."
```

[Market Practice: Morgan & Morgan uses "Results may vary depending on your particular facts and legal circumstances"]

### Disclaimer Placement Strategy

**Global Disclaimer (Footer - Every Page):**
```
The information on this website is for general information purposes only.
Nothing on this site should be taken as legal advice for any individual
case or situation. Results vary based on the specific facts and circumstances
of each case. No attorney-client relationship is created by use of this website.
```

**Outcome-Adjacent Disclaimer (Near any success language):**
```
Each case is unique. Outcomes depend on specific facts, evidence, and
circumstances. Past results do not guarantee future outcomes.
```

**Testimonial Disclaimer (With client reviews):**
```
Client testimonials represent individual experiences and do not guarantee
similar results. Results vary based on case-specific circumstances.
```

## Safe Harbor Language: Permitted Modifying Words

### Official Safe Harbor Modifiers

The Florida Bar Handbook provides a **non-exclusive list** of words that generally may be used to modify language to prevent violations:

✅ **SAFE MODIFYING WORDS:**
- **try** - "I will try to get your charges dismissed"
- **pursue** - "I will pursue an acquittal"
- **may** - "I may be able to help you achieve..."
- **seek** - "I seek the best possible outcome"
- **might** - "This might result in..."
- **could** - "We could potentially..."
- **designed to** - "Our strategy is designed to..."

[Source: Florida Bar Handbook on Lawyer Advertising and Solicitation, 2023, Safe Harbor Language]

### Examples: Prohibited vs. Permitted

| ❌ PROHIBITED | ✅ PERMITTED (with modifier) |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| "I will get you acquitted" | "I will **pursue** an acquittal of your pending charges"* |
| "We win cases" | "We **strive** for the best possible outcome" |
| "I save homes from foreclosure" | "I **work to** help you explore options for saving your home" |
| "We get charges dismissed" | "We are **designed to seek** dismissal when appropriate" |
| "Guaranteed favorable settlement" | "We **pursue** the most favorable settlement **possible**" |

*Approved by Standing Committee on Advertising

### Aspirational Language (Generally Permitted)

Aspirational statements describe **goals** the lawyer/firm will **try** to meet, not guaranteed outcomes.

✅ **SAFE ASPIRATIONAL WORDS:**
- goal
- strive
- dedicated
- committed
- mission
- philosophy
- focused on
- work toward
- aim to

### Examples of Permitted Aspirational Language

✅ "Our **goal** is to protect your family and assets"
✅ "We are **dedicated to** achieving justice for our clients"
✅ "My **mission** is to provide aggressive representation"
✅ "We **strive** for the best possible outcomes"

---

## Specialist/Expert Prohibition

### Rule 4-7.14: The "Expert" Rule

Florida Rule 4-7.14 **prohibits** stating or implying that a lawyer specializes in an area of law **unless the lawyer is board certified**.

This is **one of the most commonly violated rules** in Florida attorney advertising.

[Source: Florida Bar Rule 4-7.14]

### PROHIBITED Words (Unless Board Certified)

❌ **Do NOT Use:**
- "Specialist"
- "Specialize"
- "Expert"
- "Expertise" (when implying specialist status)
- "Certified specialist" (unless actually board certified by Florida Bar)

### PERMITTED Alternatives

✅ **Use Instead:**
- "Practice areas include..."
- "Focused on..."
- "Concentrates on..."
- "Handles cases involving..."
- "Experience in..."
- "Dedicated to..."
- "Limits practice to..."

### Examples

| ❌ PROHIBITED | ✅ PERMITTED |
|--------------|-------------|
| "Criminal defense **specialist**" | "Attorney **focused on** criminal defense" |
| "Family law **expert**" | "**Experienced** family law attorney" |
| "**Certified specialist** in DUI defense" | "**Over 25 years** practicing DUI defense" |
| "Legal **expertise** in divorce" | "**Concentrates practice on** divorce and family law" |

## Bo Porta's Requested Language: Compliance Analysis

### The Request

> "We need to add the word, **aggressive**, **litigation strategy**, or **assertive litigation strategy** with **consistent good faith settlement negotiations simultaneously**"

### Evidence-Based Compliance Assessment

#### Component 1: "Aggressive Litigation Strategy"

**Compliance Status:** ✅ **PERMITTED** (with proper context)

**Analysis:**
- **"Strategy"** = Describes attorney's **approach**, not case **outcome**
- **"Aggressive"** = Describes methodology, similar to "vigorous advocacy"
- **Balance Required:** Must be paired with professionalism markers to avoid "Pit Bull Problem"

[Source: Pit Bull Advertisement Case principle - aggressive imagery without professional balance can be misleading]

**Market Practice Evidence:**
- Similar language observed in compliance from top Florida firms
- Commonly used when balanced with ethical/professional qualifiers

[Market Example: Multiple Miami criminal defense firms use "aggressive representation" with disclaimers]

#### Component 2: "Consistent Good Faith Settlement Negotiations Simultaneously"

**Compliance Status:** ✅ **PERMITTED**

**Analysis:**
- **"Negotiations"** = Describes attorney **activity**, not case **result**
- **"Good faith"** = Ethical conduct marker (professional balance)
- **"Simultaneously"** = Temporal/methodological descriptor
- **No outcome implied** - Pure process description

#### Combined Phrase Analysis

**Overall Assessment:** ✅ **LOW RISK** when implemented with proper disclaimer

**Why This Combination Works:**

1. **Balance Architecture:** "Aggressive" + "good faith" signals vigorous but ethical advocacy
2. **Dual-Track Methodology:** Shows comprehensive approach without promising outcomes
3. **Process-Only Language:** Both components describe attorney conduct, not case results
4. **No Certainty Markers:** Absence of "will," "guarantee," "ensure"

---

### Recommended Implementation Options

#### OPTION A: Maximum Safety (Most Conservative)

```
We employ a dual-track approach: preparing aggressive litigation strategies
while simultaneously engaging in good faith settlement negotiations. This
methodology is designed to pursue the best possible outcome for your case.

[Disclaimer - Clear and Conspicuous]
Results depend on the specific facts of each matter. No attorney can
guarantee any particular outcome.
```

**Risk Level:** MINIMAL

---

#### OPTION B: Balanced Professionalism

```
Our practice combines aggressive trial preparation with consistent good faith
settlement negotiations, positioning our clients for the strongest available
resolution whether in court or through negotiation.

[Disclaimer - Clear and Conspicuous]
Results vary based on case-specific circumstances.
```

**Risk Level:** LOW

---

#### OPTION C: Bo's Original Language + Strategic Enhancement (RECOMMENDED)

```
We implement an aggressive litigation strategy while maintaining consistent
good faith settlement negotiations simultaneously. This dual approach is
designed to advocate vigorously for our clients' interests and pursue the
most favorable resolution, recognizing that outcomes depend on the unique
facts and circumstances of each case.
```

**Why This Is Recommended:**
1. ✅ Preserves Bo's exact requested phrasing (stylistic consistency)
2. ✅ Adds "designed to" and "pursue" qualifiers (safe harbor language)
3. ✅ Uses "most favorable" not "the best" (bounded aspiration)
4. ✅ Includes integrated disclaimer ("recognizing that...")
5. ✅ Balances aggressive with "good faith" (avoids Pit Bull Problem)
6. ✅ Focuses on attorney conduct, not case results

**Risk Level:** LOW (with proper placement and formatting)

---

### Where to Add This Language

**Recommended Sections:**
- ✅ About page ("My Approach" or "Philosophy" section)
- ✅ Practice area pages (Family Law, Criminal Defense - methodology sections)
- ✅ Homepage credentials or philosophy section (not hero headline)

**DO NOT place in:**
- ❌ Hero headlines (too prominent, reads like primary promise)
- ❌ CTA buttons (action-focused, not descriptive)
- ❌ Without accompanying disclaimer nearby

---

## The Five Critical Compliance Rules

### CRITICAL RULE 1: The Absolute Guarantee Prohibition

**Rule:** No outcome guarantees, promises, or assurances of results.

[Source: Florida Bar Rule 4-7.2(c)(1)(F) and (G)]

**Prohibited:**
- "We will win your case"
- "Guaranteed results"
- "We get charges dropped"

**Permitted:**
- "We pursue acquittal" [Standing Committee: Permitted]
- "We strive for the best possible outcome"
- "Designed to seek dismissal"

**The Test:** Does this create a reasonable expectation of a specific result?

---

### CRITICAL RULE 2: Clear and Conspicuous Disclaimers (2023 Standard)

**Rule:** Disclaimers must be "clear and conspicuous," not merely present.

[Source: Florida Supreme Court Case No. SC2022-1294, effective August 21, 2023]

**Compliance Checklist:**
- ✓ Proximity (near the claim)
- ✓ Size (readable, not fine print)
- ✓ Contrast (visually distinct)
- ✓ Clarity (plain language)
- ✓ Placement (visible without scrolling)

**Standard Disclaimer:**
```
Results vary based on the specific facts and circumstances of each case.
Past results do not guarantee future outcomes.
```

---

### CRITICAL RULE 3: No False Expertise Claims

**Rule:** Cannot claim "specialist," "expert," or variations without Florida Bar board certification.

[Source: Florida Bar Rule 4-7.14]

**Prohibited Without Certification:**
- "Expert in family law"
- "Criminal defense specialist"

**Permitted:**
- "Focuses practice on family law and criminal defense"
- "Over 25 years practicing criminal defense"

---

### CRITICAL RULE 4: No Creation of Unjustified Expectations

**Rule:** Even aspirational language cannot create unjustified expectations.

[Source: Florida Bar Rule 4-7.13 + Standing Committee Interpretations]

**Examples:**

❌ **"Get A Fresh Start!"** - Standing Committee: Creates unjustified expectations
✅ **"We work to help you move forward"** - General progress, not specific outcome

❌ **"Money Back Guarantee"** - Standing Committee: Misleading for criminal/family law
✅ **"Contingency fee basis"** - Factual payment structure

---

### CRITICAL RULE 5: Professional Image and Tone

**Rule:** Overall impression cannot suggest improper tactics.

[Source: Florida Supreme Court Pit Bull Advertisement Case]

**The Pit Bull Principle:**
- Aggressive imagery suggesting "combative and vicious tactics" = misleading
- Visual and verbal tone must maintain professionalism

**Application to "Aggressive" Language:**

⚠ **RISKY:** "Aggressive" without balance
✅ **SAFE:** "Aggressive litigation strategy" + "good faith negotiations"

**The Balance Test:**
For every "aggressive" element, include:
- Professionalism marker ("good faith," "ethical," "professional")
- Process description (not outcome)
- Qualifier ("designed to," "while maintaining")

---

## Language Audit Self-Assessment

### Three-Pass Audit System

#### PASS 1: Guarantee Scan

**Search all website text for:**
- "will" + outcome words (win, dismiss, reduce, etc.)
- "guarantee"
- "ensure" + outcome
- "promise"

**Action:** Flag for revision or removal

---

#### PASS 2: Expertise Scan

**Search for:**
- "expert"
- "specialist"
- "specialize"
- "certified" (verify actual certification)

**Action:** Verify board certification OR replace with:
- "experienced"
- "focuses on"
- "concentrates on"

---

#### PASS 3: Expectation Scan

**Read each outcome-related claim and ask:**
"Would a reasonable person expect a specific result from this language?"

**Action:**
- If YES → Add qualifiers or disclaimers
- If MAYBE → Add disclaimer at minimum
- If NO → Verify no visual/contextual issues

---

### High-Risk Language Requiring Immediate Revision

❌ **Unqualified Result Language**
- "We get results"
- "We will win your case"
- "Guaranteed acquittal"

**Fix:** Add modal qualifiers + disclaimer

---

❌ **Unjustified Expectation Creation**
- "Get a fresh start" [Standing Committee: Prohibited]
- "Make your problems disappear"

**Fix:** Revise to process-focused language

---

❌ **False Expertise Claims**
- "Expert criminal defense lawyer" (without certification)
- "Certified specialist in family law" (without actual certification)

**Fix:** "Experienced criminal defense attorney" OR "Over [X] years practicing family law"

---

### Moderate-Risk Language Needing Careful Framing

⚠ **"Aggressive" Language Without Balance**
- "Aggressive representation" (standing alone)

**Fix:** "Aggressive litigation strategy combined with good faith negotiations"

---

⚠ **Success Statistics Without Disclaimers**
- "95% success rate" (no disclaimer)

**Fix:** Add clear and conspicuous disclaimer: "Past results do not guarantee future outcomes. Success defined as [criteria]. Results vary based on case facts."

---

### Low-Risk Language (Generally Safe)

✅ **Factual Credentials**
- "Florida Bar member since 1996"
- "Former Assistant State Attorney"
- "Juris Doctor, Tulane Law School"
- "25+ years of legal experience"

✅ **Process Descriptions**
- "We develop personalized strategies"

- "We prepare thorough trial defenses"

✅ **Qualified Aspirations**
- "We strive for the best possible outcome"
- "Designed to pursue favorable results"
- "We may be able to reduce charges"

---

## Summary: The Compliance Formula

### Three-Layer Safety Architecture

**LAYER 1: Primary Language Structure**
- Use effort verbs: "strive," "fight," "pursue," "work"
- Deploy modal qualifiers: "may," "designed to," "seek to"
- Bound aspirations: "best possible" not "the best"
- Focus on process: "develop strategy," "prepare defense"

**LAYER 2: Balance and Context**
- Pair "aggressive" with professional markers
- Show dual-track approach (litigation + settlement)
- Include methodology explanations
- Provide factual credentials

**LAYER 3: Disclaimer System**
- Clear and conspicuous placement (2023 standard)
- Outcome variability statements
- Case-specific acknowledgments
- Proximity to claims

---

### Golden Rules

1. **NEVER guarantee outcomes** - Use modal qualifiers (pursue, strive, designed to, may)

2. **ALWAYS use clear and conspicuous disclaimers** - Outcome variability must be prominent (2023 standard)

3. **NEVER claim expertise without certification** - Use "experienced," "focuses on," not "expert" or "specialist"

4. **NEVER create unjustified expectations** - Even aspirational language must be realistic and qualified

5. **ALWAYS balance aggressive language** - Pair with professionalism markers and ethical conduct references
